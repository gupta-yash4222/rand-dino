# rand-dino

This project has been done under a course on deep neural networks from Coursera. 

The project aims to generate random dinosaur names. Usually dinosaurs' names end with "saurs" or so. The model learns this pattern from a very large data-set containing known dinosaurs names. With a random seed given, the model generates a dinosaur name randomly, which actually sounds like to be a known dinosaur.
